# AI-Assisted Webpage Assignment

For this assignment, I used GitHub Copilot in VS Code to build `emailsettings.html`, a professional email preferences form for tax-related communications.

The page includes:
- Four checkbox options for email preferences
- A Save button that submits to `https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php`
- A Select/Deselect All feature using JavaScript
- Bootstrap styling for a clean, responsive layout

I iterated with multiple AI prompts and made manual refinements to ensure everything worked correctly.
